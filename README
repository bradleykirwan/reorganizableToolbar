# Reorganizable Toolbar
### Goal
I wanted a way to rearrange nodes within a JavaFX ToolBar, that was user friendly and required no extra changes to existing code by the developer.

### How to use
`ReorganizableToolBar` extends from JavaFX's `ToolBar` and can be created as simply as
```java
ToolBar toolbar = new ReorganizableToolBar();
```

### Known issues
Random "file" icon shown when dragging a node (Ideally this would be removed and the cursor changed to open/closed hand)
